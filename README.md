# Mendham
Mendham is an open source library for building modern .NET applications with a high level of testability. It compliments a domain-driven design (DDD) approach by serving as foundation that makes business logic to be the primary focus. It provides infrastructure for domain elements that can easily be integrated with modern software practices including dependency injection and asynchronous programming and unit testing.
